        <p>A blocked air intake error can be caused by a restriction in the intake pipe, high wind conditions or a faulty air intake pressure switch.</p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>Clear the fault by pressing disable, then enable.</li>
            <li>If the error comes back before the blower starts, the blocked air intake pressure switch may be disconnected or is faulty.</li>
            <li>Make sure the connections are clean and tight.</li>
            <li>Set your multi-meter set to continuity.</li>
            <li>Check the terminals on the switch.</li>
            <li>You should get a beep indicating the switch is closed.</li>
            <li>If you don’t get a beep, replace the switch.</li>
            <li>If you do get a beep, check the wiring and the plug on the circuit board.</li>
            <li>If the blocked intake error doesn’t appear until after the blower starts check for restrictions in the intake pipe, intake air connections and the outside termination.</li>
            <li>Also check for excessive equivalent length.</li>
            <li>Refer to the installation manual for pipe size, length and maximum number of elbows. Remember that each plastic pipe elbow is the equivalent of five feet.</li>
            <li>If there is no blockage in the air intake pipe but you still get a blocked air intake error, replace the blocked intake pressure switch.</li>

        <h5>Enable/Disable Switch</h5>
        <p>The enable disable switch is located right below the display. It must be in the enable position to allow the water heater to operate. It is not an on/off switch and does not turn off power to the control board. Press disable to prevent the unit from operating or press enable to allow the water heater to operate. The enable disable switch is separate from the enable disable circuit which is often connected to a timer or a building management system.

        </div>
        <p>A low gas pressure error can be caused by low gas pressure or a faulty low gas pressure switch.</p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>If the gas supply pressure is too low the switch will open and you will get a low gas pressure error.</li>
            <li>First, check and make sure the gas supply pressure is correct.</li>
            <li>See the water heaters data plate for the minimum required gas supply pressure for this model.</li>
            <li>You’ll need a gas pressure gauge or manometer for this test.</li>
            <li>Turn off the gas supply.</li>
            <li>Open the needle valve inside the gas supply pressure test port one full turn only. Attach the hose from your gas gauge or manometer.</li>
            <li>Turn the gas supply back on and read the pressure.</li>
            <li>If the pressure is below the data plate specification, check for problems with the gas supply such as, closed valves, a bad regulator or too many appliances on the same supply line.</li>
            <li>If the pressure is above the minimum requirement, turn the gas supply off, and close the needle valve. Then turn the gas supply back on.</li>
            <li>Now check the low gas pressure switch.</li>
            <li>The connections should be clean and tight.</li>
            <li>Using a multi-meter set to continuity, check the terminals on the switch.</li>
            <li>You should hear a beep indicating the switch is closed.</li>
            <li>If you have the correct gas pressure and you don’t hear a beep meaning the switch still is open, replace the low gas pressure switch.</li>

        <p>The blower prover pressure switch is a normally open switch that closes when the blower starts to prove that the blower is running. A blower prover failure error occurs when the blower prover switch is closed before the blower runs.</p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>Set the enable/disable switch to disable.</li>
            <li>The blower will not operate when the unit is disabled, so the blower prover switch should be open.</li>
            <li>Using a multi-meter set to continuity, check the terminals on the switch.</li>
            <li>You should not hear a beep meaning that the switch is open.</li>

        <p>A blower operation not detected error occurs when the blower prover switch does not detect that the blower is running.</p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>Before the blower runs, the blower prover switch is open and when the blower starts, air pressure from the blower closes the switch, proving that the blower is running.</li>

            <li>Clear the fault by pressing disable, then enable.</li>
            <li>Verify that the blower is running when the fan icon appears. If the blower doesn’t start when the fan icon appears, check the blower. Make sure its connections are clean and tight.</li>
            <li>If the blower does run, clear any blockage in the pressure tube and clean out the sample port on the blower housing.</li>

        </div>
        <p>An ignition failure error occurs when the flame sense rod does not detect flame. This could be because there is no flame or simply because the flame sensor rod doesn’t see it.</p>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>Clear the fault by pressing disable, then enable.</li>
            <li>Watch the display.</li>
            <li>When the gas valve icon appears, look through the sight glass for a brief blue flame.</li>
            <li>If you see a brief blue flame, but the flame sense rod doesn’t detect it, you’ll get an ignition failure error.</li>
            <li>Check the flame sensing rod.</li>
            <li>Make sure the connections are clean and tight.</li>
            <li>Remove the flame rod and clean with steel wool.</li>
            <li>Check the insulator for soot or damage.</li>
            <li>Replace the flame rod if necessary.</li>
            <li>If you don’t see a brief blue flame when the gas valve icon appears, that could mean an issue with the supply gas pressure.</li>
            <li>Make sure the gas valve electrical connections are clean and tight.</li>
            <li>You’ll need a gas pressure gauge or manometer for this next test.</li>
            <li>Shut off the gas supply.</li>
            <li>Set the enable/disable switch to disable.</li>
            <li>Open the needle valve inside the gas supply pressure test port one full turn only. Attach the hose from your gas gauge or manometer.</li>
            <li>Turn the gas supply back on and press enable.</li>
            <li>Purge gas by disconnecting tube from manometer or gas gauge and reconnecting to eliminate spike in pressure reading.</li>
            <li>When the gas valve icon appears on the display, you should see a pressure drop at the gas supply—at least a half inch drop. If you don’t see any pressure drop, the gas valve is not opening.</li>
            <li>Run the test again, this time looking for 24 volts AC on the gas valve connector on the control board at the exact moment the gas valve icon appears on the display. If you get 24 volts AC, replace the gas valve. If you don’t get 24 volts ac, replace the control board. Remember that you are only going to get 24 volts ac on the gas valve connector on the control board when the gas valve icon appears on the display and when you have an ignition failure, that’s only going to be for two or three seconds.</li>
            <li>Also check for restrictions in the heat exchanger such as a blocked condensate drain.</li>
            <li>If the unit passes all these tests, contact commercial technical support.</li>
